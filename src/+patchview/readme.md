patchview 
=========
A visualization library for patchlib

Currently still in development. 

Throughout the documentation, we'll use the same conventions as in patchlib

requires several functions from mgt (https://github.com/adalca/mgt)

TODO
----
- viewKNNSearch, using functions from viewPatchesInImage
- view kNN patches (maybe with image?) with scores on top.
