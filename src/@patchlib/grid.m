function [idx, newVolSize, nPatches, overlap] = grid(volSize, patchSize, varargin)
% GRID grid of patch starting points for n-d volume
%     idx = grid(volSize, patchSize) computed the grid of patches that fit into volSize given a 
%     particular patchSize, and return the indexes of the top-left voxel of each patch. patchSize
%     should be the same length as volSize. By default, the patches are assumed to be sliding - that
%     is, patches will have an overlap of (patchSize - 1). See below for specifying patch overlaps.
% 
%     The index is in the given volume. If the volume gets cropped as part of the function and you
%     want a linear indexing into the new volume size, use >> newidx = ind2ind(newVolSize, volSize,
%     idx); newVolSize can be passed by the current function, see below.
% 
%     idx = grid(volSize, patchSize, patchOverlap) specifiy the amount of patch overlap. The volume
%     will be cropped to the maximum size that fits the patch grid. For example, a [6x6] volume with
%     a patchsize of [3x3] and overlap of 1 will be cropped to [5x5] volume. Overlap should be <
%     patchSize. patchOverlap should be a scalar (applied to all dim) or the same length as
%     patchSize.
% 
%     To get spacing between non-overlapping patches, enter negative overlaps.
% 
%     idx = grid(volSize, patchSize, kind) allows for pre-specified kind of overlaps: like
%     'sliding', 'discrete', or 'mrf'. see patchlib.overlapkind for details of the supported overlap
%     kinds. If not specified (i.e. function has only 2 inputs), default overlap is 'sliding'.
% 
%     idx = grid(..., patchOverlap/kind, startSub) - start the indexing at a particular location [1
%     x nDims]. This essentially means that the volume will be cropped starting at that location.
%     e.g. if startSub is [2, 2], then only vol(2:end, 2:end) will be included.
% 
%     sub = grid(..., patchOverlap/kind, 'sub') return n-D subscripts instead of linear index. sub
%     will be a 1 x nDim cell. This is equivalent to [sub{:}] = ind2sub(volSize, idx), but is done
%     faster inside this function.
% 
%     [..., newVolSize, nPatches, overlap] = grid(...) returns the size of the cropped volume, the
%     number of patches in each direction, and the size of the overlap. The latter is useful is the
%     'kind' input was used.
% 
%     TODO: could speed up for the special case of 2D or 3D?
