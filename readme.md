patchlib
========

A powerful library for working with N-D patches (currently very much in development). The library also includes several 2D and 3D examples to illustrate the library applicability.

- See [`functions`](src/functions.md) for a list of functions in this library.
- See [`examples`](examples/examples.md) for a list of examples to get you started.

Dependencies
------------
All of the code depends on two other (easy to download) matlab toolboxes. Please download these and add them to your matlab path (via `addpath(genpath(PATH_TO_TOOLBOX))`).
- [mgt](https://github.com/adalca/mgt)
- [mvit](https://github.com/adalca/mivt)

To use any of the MRF related methods, please download the 
- [UGM library by Mark Schmidt](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/UGM.html) 
and add it to your matlab path
