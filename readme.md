patchlib
========

A library for working with N-D patches, currently very much in development.
Please do a recursive pull, as the git has git submodules [mgt](https://github.com/adalca/mgt) and [mvit](https://github.com/adalca/mivt).

- See [`functions`](src/functions.md) for a list of functions in this library.
- See [`examples`](examples/examples.md) for a list of examples to get you started.

To use any of the MRF related methods, please download the external library [UGM by Mark Schmidt](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/UGM.html)
